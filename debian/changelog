ros-hydro-simple-message (0.3.4-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * robot_client: workaround for #46 <https://github.com/shaun-edwards/industrial_core/issues/46>. Fix #67 <https://github.com/shaun-edwards/industrial_core/issues/67>.
    This is an updated version of the workaround committed in 9df46977. Instead
    of requiring dependent packages to invoke the function defined in the
    CFG_EXTRAS cmake snippet, the snippet now sets up the linker path directly.
    Dependent packages now only need to remember to explicitly list their
    dependency on industrial_robot_client and simple_message in their
    add_library(..) statements.

ros-hydro-simple-message (0.3.1-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * Added polling check to socket read and muiltiple read calls in order to receive all desired bytes
  * Removed library export from catkin macro.  Packages that depend on these must declare library dependencies explicitly (by name)
  * Add error message to socket errors (instead of just errno).
  * Converted to catkin
